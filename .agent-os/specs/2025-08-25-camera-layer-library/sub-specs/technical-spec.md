# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-25-camera-layer-library/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core Component Architecture
- React functional component with TypeScript support
- Modular layer system using React Context for layer management
- WebRTC API for camera access (getUserMedia)
- Canvas-based rendering for performance optimization
- RequestAnimationFrame for 20fps frame processing

### Camera Management
- Automatic device enumeration and selection
- Constraint-based resolution adaptation for mobile/desktop
- Stream lifecycle management with proper cleanup
- Permission handling with user-friendly error states
- Support for front/rear camera switching on mobile

### Layer System Architecture
- Base Layer interface with lifecycle methods (onMount, onUnmount, onFrame, onDetection)
- Layer composition using React portals or canvas overlay
- Z-index management for layer ordering
- Context passing system for sharing detection data between layers
- Layer types: DetectionLayer, AnnotationLayer, InteractionLayer, CustomLayer

### Object Detection Implementation
- TensorFlow.js or MediaPipe for client-side detection
- Face detection using BlazeFace or FaceMesh models
- General object detection using COCO-SSD or MobileNet
- Web Worker implementation for non-blocking detection processing
- Configurable detection intervals and confidence thresholds

### Event System
- Custom event emitter for decoupled communication
- Frame-based events with throttling capability
- Detection events with object metadata (type, confidence, boundaries)
- Interaction events (click, hover, touch on detected objects)
- Performance events for monitoring FPS and processing time

### Performance Optimizations
- OffscreenCanvas for background processing
- Dynamic quality adjustment based on device capabilities
- Frame skipping strategy for maintaining 20fps target
- Memory management with proper cleanup and pooling
- Lazy loading of detection models

### Mobile Optimizations
- Touch gesture support for interactions
- Responsive canvas sizing with device pixel ratio handling
- Reduced model sizes for mobile devices
- Battery usage optimization with adaptive processing
- Network-aware model loading strategies

### Testing Infrastructure
- Jest for unit testing with React Testing Library
- Mock camera streams for consistent testing
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Cross-browser testing setup (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Mobile device testing framework

## External Dependencies

- **react** (^18.0.0) - Core framework
- **typescript** (^5.0.0) - Type safety and definitions
- **@tensorflow/tfjs** (^4.0.0) - Machine learning models for object detection
- **@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd** (^2.2.0) - Pre-trained object detection model
- **@tensorflow-models/blazeface** (^0.1.0) - Lightweight face detection model
- **@mediapipe/face_detection** (^0.4) - Alternative face detection solution
- **Justification:** TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe provide production-ready, client-side ML models essential for real-time object detection without server dependencies
