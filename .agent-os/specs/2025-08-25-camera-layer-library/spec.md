# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Camera Layer Library
> Created: 2025-08-25

## Overview

Develop a React-based camera view component library that provides real-time webcam/device camera access with a multi-layer system for overlays, object detection visualization, and interactive elements. This library will enable developers to build rich camera-based applications with extensible layer support for computer vision and augmented reality use cases.

## User Stories

### Developer Integration Story

As a React developer, I want to integrate a camera component with minimal configuration, so that I can quickly add camera functionality to my application.

The developer imports the Cam component, adds it to their React application with basic props, and immediately gets a working camera view. They can then progressively enhance it by adding layers for object detection, annotations, or custom overlays, with each layer receiving context about detected objects and being able to react to changes in real-time.

### End User Interaction Story

As an end user, I want to see real-time object detection overlays on my camera feed, so that I can interact with detected objects and understand what the camera is seeing.

The user grants camera permissions and sees their video feed with colored bounding boxes around detected objects (faces in one color, general objects in another). They can click on detected objects to trigger actions, see labels, or get more information. The overlays update smoothly at 20fps without lag or jitter.

### Mobile User Story

As a mobile user, I want the camera view to work smoothly on my device, so that I can use camera-based features on the go.

The mobile user accesses the web application, the camera component automatically adapts to their device's camera capabilities, maintains performance at 20fps even with multiple layers active, and provides touch-friendly interactions for clickable overlays.

## Spec Scope

1. **Camera Component** - Core React component with webcam/device camera access and live stream support
2. **Layer System** - Extensible layer architecture supporting multiple overlay types with context awareness
3. **Object Detection** - Client-side face and object detection with configurable visualization
4. **Event System** - Comprehensive event handling for detection results, frame updates, and user interactions
5. **Performance Optimization** - Maintains 20fps performance on mobile and desktop devices

## Out of Scope

- Server-side object detection processing
- Video recording functionality
- Image filters or effects processing
- Augmented reality 3D rendering
- Native mobile app implementations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working React component library with TypeScript definitions that can be imported as <Cam /> with full prop configuration
2. Comprehensive test suite demonstrating camera access, layer rendering, and object detection functionality
3. Interactive demo application showing real-time object detection with colored overlays and clickable interactions at 20fps performance
